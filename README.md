### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Welcome to My github! I am a Data Engineer, formerly in management, mostly in retail. I made the switch to Data Engineering late last year. 
## My interests include the gaming industry, reading, and pop culture. I find challenging endeavors to be my favorite thing to accomplish, 
## whether it be a game, a book, or a project. 

# A few of my projects are pinned below! Enjoy!
