## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Welcome! I am a Data Engineer, formerly in management, mostly in retail. I made the switch to Data Engineering late last year. 
### My interests include the gaming industry, reading, and pop culture. I find challenging endeavors to be my favorite thing to accomplish, whether it be a game, a book, or a project.
